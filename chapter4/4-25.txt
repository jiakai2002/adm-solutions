worst case:
sucessively pick min/max element as pivot, n partitions required
for each partition, a pivot is compared to each remaining element
after which pivot is considered sorted
say zi is selected as pivot and compared to each remaining element including zj once
after which zi is then considered
thus maximum comparison between zi and zj is 1

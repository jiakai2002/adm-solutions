(a)
no. of pivots = k
no. of elements = n
for worst case, 1 = n(1/2)^k, n = 2^k, k = log2n
since k = h, h = log2(n)

T(n) = O(n * h)
T(n) = O(nlog2(n))

(b)
no. of pivots = k
no. of elements = n
for worst case, 1 = n(2/3)^k, n = (3/2)^k, k = log(3/2)n
since k = h, h = log(3/2)n

T(n) = O(n * h)
T(n) = O(nlog(3/2)(n))

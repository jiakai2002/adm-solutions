best case:
succesively pick the median as pivot so each partition halves the array
let k = no. of partitions
1 = n/2^k
k = lg2(n)
minimum recursion depth: lg2(n)

worst case:
succesively pick the min/max as pivot so each partition decrements the array
let k = no. of partitions
1 = n-k
k = n
maximum recursion depth: n

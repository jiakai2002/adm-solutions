max-heap operations
construction: O(nlogn)

find max: O(1)
insert: O(logn)

sorted array operations

find max: O(1)
search: O(logn)
insert: O(n)
delete: O(n)

(a) Does not matter. Both take O(1) time

(b) Does not matter. Both take O(n) time

(c) Does not matter. Both take O(n) time (faster heap construction using bubble_down)

(d) Sorted array. Takes O(1) time compared to O(n) for max-heap.

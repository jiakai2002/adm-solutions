max-heap operations

find max: O(1)
insert: O(logn)

sorted array operations

search: O(logn)
insert: O(n)
delete: O(n)

(a) Does not matter. Both take O(1) time

(b) If index is not known, both takes O(n). 
    If index is known, max-heap takes O(logn) time to bubble_down 
    while sorted array takes O(n).

(c) Heap takes O(n) time (using bubble_down). Sorted_array takes O(nlogn) for n inserts.

(d) Sorted array takes O(1) time. Max-heap needs to visit each leaf node so O(n) time.
